  storyText: 'This dust storm, uh! The ravaging wind is blocking my vision! I am
    not even sure if this is the correct path to Eden. Peh! Stupid sand getting in
    my mouth, I should have brought my visors. My legs are getting sore walking against
    this storm on the sand but master Brinks will be waiting for the asset to be
    delivered, I cannot fail him. But I am tired, what if I faint! Wait, is that
    a cave? Maybe I can rest a little bit.


    Should I rest?


    1. Okay, let
    me take a break

    2. No, mission is more important
